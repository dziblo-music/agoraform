# Google Ads provider

The Google Ads provider is Agoraform's authenticated API foundation for
v0.3 conversion-tracking resources. This package registers as `googleads`
and exposes a reusable REST client. Conversion actions and other Google Ads
resources are not implemented yet.

The Agoraform CLI remains provider-neutral. There is no Google Ads-specific
command.

## Runtime configuration

Credentials and connection details come from environment variables:

```text
GOOGLE_ADS_DEVELOPER_TOKEN     required   Google Ads API developer token
GOOGLE_ADS_CLIENT_ID           required   OAuth 2.0 client ID
GOOGLE_ADS_CLIENT_SECRET       required   OAuth 2.0 client secret
GOOGLE_ADS_REFRESH_TOKEN       required   OAuth 2.0 refresh token
GOOGLE_ADS_CUSTOMER_ID         required   10-digit customer ID (hyphens optional)
GOOGLE_ADS_LOGIN_CUSTOMER_ID   optional   manager account customer ID
```

Tokens never belong in the manifest, logs, plan output, or local state.
Interactive OAuth consent is not implemented; supply a previously issued
refresh token.

Customer IDs are normalized before API calls: hyphens, spaces, and a
`customers/` prefix are stripped so REST paths and the `login-customer-id`
header always receive a 10-digit identifier.

## Declarative provider configuration

The foundation has no non-secret YAML fields yet. An empty `providers.googleads`
block is accepted and still validates environment credentials. Putting OAuth
secrets or the developer token in the manifest is rejected.

```yaml
apiVersion: agoraform.io/v1alpha1
providers:
  googleads: {}
resources: []
```

Unknown provider configuration fields are rejected.

## Resources

No Google Ads resource types are registered yet. Follow-up work adds
`googleads.conversion_action`.

## HTTP client

`providers/googleads/client` centralizes Google Ads REST calls, including:

- OAuth 2.0 refresh-token exchange and access-token caching;
- `developer-token` and optional `login-customer-id` headers;
- Google Ads Query Language search with pagination;
- resource mutate requests;
- API version selection (`v25`) so upgrades stay in one place;
- Google Ads / OAuth error mapping and secret redaction.

Provider resource code should use this client rather than issuing ad hoc HTTP
requests. Override `Config.BaseURL` and `Config.TokenURL` in tests.

## Safety

- `agoraform plan` does not mutate Google Ads.
- Authentication secrets are redacted from provider errors.
- Tests use local `httptest` servers only.
